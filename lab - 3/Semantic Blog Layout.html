            <p> My  1st-semester as a student has been an exciting and challenging experience. I was nervous at first but soon made new friends and learned to manage my time better. The courses introduced me to new ideas and helped me grow both academically and personally. I look forward to what the upcoming years will bring and hope to make the most of my college life.This kind of content is personal, relatable, and easy to write as a 1st-semester student.</p>

            </header>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies that help me relax and express my creativity. One of my favorite pastimes is coding, as it allows me to explore my side and unwind after a long day of classes. I also love reading, particularly fantasy novels, which transport me to different worlds and spark my imagination. Additionally, I enjoy playing the guitar, which has been a great way to connect with friends and share music together. These hobbies not only bring me joy but also help me maintain a balanced lifestyle as a student.</p>
